# DailyUI

Welcome! This is a place where I keep track of my progress for the Daily UI Design Challenge. You can find more about the challenge [here](https://www.dailyui.co/). Over the next 100 days, I'll design 100 different user interface elements for mobile and web. 

Scroll down below for an overview of my design for each prompt. For more details on my process for each design, head over to the [Wiki](https://github.com/panjenny0/DailyUI/wiki) for this repo.

### My reasoning behind doing this
As someone who has an interest in both design and development, I wanted to further my skills in UI/UX. I also want to keep myself accountable and try to commit to doing something for 100 days. We'll see where this goes!

### Future directions
As an extension of this project, I may potentially do another challenge where I implement one of these screens everyday for 100 days. Stay tuned :)
