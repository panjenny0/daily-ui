# DailyUI

Welcome! This is a place where I keep track of my progress for the Daily UI Design Challenge. You can find more about the challenge [here](https://www.dailyui.co/). Over the next 100 days, I'll design 100 different user interface elements for mobile and web. 

**Scroll down below** for an overview of my design for each prompt. For more details on my process for each design, head over to the [Wiki](https://github.com/panjenny0/DailyUI/wiki) for this repo.

### My reasoning behind doing this
As someone who has an interest in both design and development, I wanted to further my skills in UI/UX. I also want to keep myself accountable and try to commit to doing something for 100 days. We'll see where this goes!

### Future directions
As an extension of this project, I may potentially do another challenge where I implement one of these screens everyday for 100 days. Stay tuned :)
